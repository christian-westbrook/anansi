## Getting Started

The following sections provides instructions to quickly get started. If you get stuck at any point, feel free to reach out for help. The best way to do so is to [create an issue](https://github.com/christian-westbrook/portfolio-web-system/issues).

### Prerequisites
- You have [PHP](https://www.php.net/) installed on your production machine
- You have web server software installed and configured to use PHP on your production machine
	- [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/) is free and supports PHP
	- PHP needs to be [enabled](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42654694/enable-php-apache2) if using Apache

### Create
- Use `/public/blogs/demo.xml` as an example to start writing blogs
- Place completed blogs into the `/public/blogs/` folder and referenced images into the `/public/img/` folder
- Regularly back up `/public/blogs/` and `/public/img/`
	- Learn more in the [authoring blog posts](#authoring-blog-posts) section

### Deploy
- Move the contents of the `/public/` folder into your web server's deployment directory
- If kept separate, copy your `/blogs/`, `/img/`, and `config.json` into the deployment directory
- Navigate to your deployed system using a web browser to confirm success
	- Learn more in the [deployment](#deploy) section

## Access

You can access the Anansi platform by either cloning the [repository](https://github.com/christian-westbrook/portfolio-web-system.git) or by downloading the latest [release](https://github.com/christian-westbrook/anansi/releases).

## Configure

You can customize your deployment through the use of system configuration settings located in the file `/public/config.json`. Each entry within this JSON file represents a particular setting. To change a setting, modify and save its value in the `config.json` file. It's a good idea to regularly back up this file.

The following configuration settings are currently supported:  
- **domain** - The domain name of your site  
- **title** - The text rendered in the site heading  

As an example, the following `config.json` file is deployed at [christianwestbrook.dev](https://www.christianwestbrook.dev/).  

`{`  
`"domain" : "https://www.christianwestbrook.dev",`  
`"title"  : "christianwestbrook.dev"`  
`}`  

More configuration settings are planned for future releases. To request a particular setting, feel free to submit an issue [here](https://github.com/christian-westbrook/portfolio-web-system/issues) using the `enhancement` label.

## Create

Blog posts are defined in XML format and stored in the `/public/blogs/` directory. To add a new blog post to the system, create a new blog file using the following XML format and place it in the `/public/blogs/` directory. The blog engine will detect all blog files stored in this directory and render them as blog posts in order from the most recent post to the oldest post.

The following code block demonstrates the minimal requirements for a single blog post.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<blog>
	<title></title>
	<author></author>
	<abstract></abstract>
	<thumbnail></thumbnail>
	<content></content>
	<date></date>
	<time></time>
</blog>
```

Additional optional tags that are not currently being used, but for which we have plans to implement, include `<excerpt>` and `<tag>`, with planned support for multiple `<tag>` entries in the same blog post.  

The `<content>` tag currently supports a subset Markdown symbols. Complete support of all Markdown syntax is planned for the future. The following Markdown elements are currently supported:

- Heading - #, ##, ###, etc.
- Bold - \*\*bold text\*\*
- Italic - \*italicized text\*
- Bold & Italic - \*\*\*bold and italicized text\*\*\*
- Link - \[title\]\(https://www.example.com\)
- Image - !\[alt text\]\(image.jpg\)

More blog authoring features are planned for future releases. To request a particular feature, feel free to submit an issue [here](https://github.com/christian-westbrook/portfolio-web-system/issues) using the `enhancement` label.

## Deploy

In this section we briefly describe the release process supporting site deployment at christianwestbrook.dev to demonstrate what a Portfolio Web System release process could look like.

- Ensure that the origin Raspberry Pi server is online
- Connect to the origin server
- Ensure that the Apache HTTP Server is online with the terminal command `service apache2 start`
- Clone the repository onto the origin server
- Check out and pull the target release branch
- Create a backup of the existing deployment by zipping all contents of the Apache HTTP Server deployment directory at `//var/www/html/`
- Copy all contents of the `/public/` directory within the repository to the Apache HTTP Server deployment directory at `//var/www/html/`
- Create an `/img/` directory within the Apache HTTP Server deployment directory at `//var/www/html/`
- Move desired blog data into `//var/www/html/blogs/`
- Move desired image data into `//var/www/html/img/`
- Navigate to [www.christianwestbrook.dev](https://www.christianwestbrook.dev) to confirm that the newly released web system is available
